# DIY-SMD-Soldering-Station
A DIY Soldering Station with ATMega2560 and SMD parts

Many thanks to Matthias <https://debugginglab.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/soldering-station/> for
the inspiration.
There were some improvments to UI with insertion of bargraphs for desired and actual temperature, 
indication for memory saved last desired temperature and settings with rotary endoder instead of
pot.

It would be also a remiss not to thank Stefanos Tselepis FireDeveloper <https://github.com/FireDeveloper> for his
aewosome RGB MultyBit Calculator. It helped a lot for developing code with MCUFRIEND small TFT.

From version  and later, the combatible TFT is this:
